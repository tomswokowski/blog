summary: 'I set out to understand what the painpoints of Shopify merchants currently were for the purpose of determining potentially profitable Shopify App ideas. The project is still ongoing and right now I have only created a rough (but successful) scraping tool in Java that pulls all of the reviews from the Shopify App store and saves it into an AWS RDS postgresql database.'
