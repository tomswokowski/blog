## TLDR (Too long, didn’t read)

When you’re learning something, eventually you will reach a point of diminishing returns. Instead of continuing with it and trying to cram more studying in, take a break and do something you enjoy. After some time has passed, come back to whatever it is that you’re learning. You’ll not only live a more fulfilling life, you’ll also learn more effectively. It’s a win-win all around.

## I’m Turning 30 in 2 months, Time for Some Reflection

As the calendar turns to May and the weather is finally starting to get warmer in Wisconsin, it suddenly hit me one morning that I will be turning 30 years old in two months. Upon this realization, I immediately took some time to do some serious reflecting on the last few years of my life. When I was in my mid twenties, I really only had one primary professional goal and that was to transition careers from Accounting to Software Development. I honestly never really considered personal goals much at the time and I’ll touch on why this was a big mistake later in this post.

When I was around 25 or so and had about 4 years of professional experience under my belt working in Accounting, I realized I needed to develop a hard skill that will be valuable throughout my entire career. That’s not to say that Accounting isn’t a hard skill, it just wasn’t a skill that I was motivated enough to develop to a high enough level that I deemed acceptable. Anyway, I naturally gravitated towards programming because in my Accounting job there were certain situations where I would use or create little programs that would automate an otherwise manual task. These were typically in the form Excel macros. It was always so satisfying and fun to turn on the Application.ScreenUpdating property so you could physically see the spreadsheet updating automatically as the macro ran. Long story short, my interest in programming kind of grew from there.

Other than my general interest in programming, there were actually three other considerations that led me down this path that I’ll just quickly mention. Number one is that I wanted to work from home. More specifically, I wanted to have the flexibility to work from anywhere. It’s just a personal preference as I am more introverted by nature and I’m not really into the corporate scene. Number two is that someday I want to start my own business or create my own app that I can make a living from as a solo entrepreneur. This reason was a little bit naive because software development is much more of a team activity than I realized, but it remains a goal of mine nonetheless. Lastly, I wanted to make a higher salary. I stumbled upon the website levels.fyi and saw how much money people were making at certain companies right out of the gate. Simply put, I wanted to be at that level salary wise.

After countless long nights and thousands of hours studying, I was finally able to make the transition from Accounting to Software Development on January 4th, 2021. It was the first day I was actually paid to write code and it was a dream come true for me. It was exactly what I had set out to do for myself about three and a half years earlier. As a side note, yes it did take me that long to transition. If I could do it over, I think I would have quit my Accounting job immediately and taken the extra 40+ hours a week to study full time while earning my addtional degree in Computer Science. Doing it that way, I think I could have made the transition much faster but that’s neither here nor there and it all worked out in the end.

In retrospect, I accomplished exactly what I had set out to do. I successfully transitioned careers from Accounting to Software Development. Unfortunately the story gets a bit more somber from here. During my three to four year transition period of trying to accomplish this goal, I realized that I pretty much gave up everything else for it. This was all done unconsciously and gradually over time. There was just a little bit less time for everything. A little bit less time to hang out with friends. A little bit less time to work out and exercise. A little bit less time to cook and eat something healthy. A little bit less time for golf. As time went on, the “little bit less time” became essentially “no time”. The only thing I ever felt I had time for was to learn more about programming. Despite all of this, I still lived a very happy life during this time so I am not going to get any more dramatic than I already have. Although, I did cut out a lot of very healthy and good habits that I enjoyed during my high school and college years.

I truly dreaded whenever someone asked me the simple and innocent question of “What do you like to do for fun?” I always ended up lying and telling them something I “used” to like to do. The discussion never led anywhere interesting because I was now so out of touch with those hobbies that I felt I no longer had the ability to bring anything of value to the conversation.

After reflecting on this recently, I concluded that my current habits are not sustainable for much longer. I’ve started to notice some signs of burnout and noticed that I’m not on my “A” game as consistently as I used to be. I even started becoming more disinterested and lazy when it comes to programming, the one thing I had been dedicating most of my time to. When I used to be able to focus for hours at a time, now sometimes it became only minutes, if that. I still love programming, I love my job, and I love learning new things, but there has to be some balance with other activities.

For a while now, I’ve been under a false impression that if I just grind hard and put in double digits hours learning programming every day, then I will eventually become a great programmer. Don’t get me wrong, there is definitely a lot of merit to putting in hard work consistently to get better at something, but there does reach a point of diminishing returns. Programming and learning to code is a very mentally taxing activity that can end up feeling very physical. In other words, after a long session I feel worn out physically and the last thing I feel like doing is going to the gym or cooking a healthy meal.

My solution to this is just to be much more optimal with my time going forward. Smaller periods of really strong focus coupled with periods where I am enjoying myself and doing hobbies that I love to do, such as golf. I’m predicting that when I reflect on this a year from now, I not only will be living a much more fulfilling life, I will also be a much better programmer as a result. There’s actually some science behind this and I read a really good book a few years back that covers this topic. It’s called “A Mind for Numbers: How to Excel at Math and Science (Even if You Flunked Algebra)” by Barbara Oakley. It’s all about strategies of how you can learn and retain information more effectively and how the brain takes in and processes information. One of the main points is that in order to learn effectively, you actually need to go do something else and give your brain a chance to completely forget what you were focusing on. Do you ever get really stuck on a hard problem and then you go take a walk or do something else only to come back a few hours later and immediately solve the problem you were stuck on? It’s a strange phenomenon and actually happens to me quite often when programming. It’s a really good book and I would definitely recommend it regardless of what career you are in. I’m not sure why I didn’t implement the advice presented in that book when I read it a few years back.

Anyway, I mainly wrote all of this to hold myself accountable so that I can focus more on my hobbies than I have been in the last few years. I believe that doing this will also help my career and make me a better developer. It’s truly a win-win. Today, on 05/08/2022, I picked up a golf club for the first time in almost five years and got an hour’s worth of practice in. It felt great and I am proud of myself for that and I plan on continuing to make time for activities outside of coding.
